                        <li>Class 1: World Studies - This class is a hybrid of English and World Geography, making the work twice as difficult. I am not the best when it comes to Geopgraphy, especially World Geography (I barely knew whe$
                        <li>Class 2: Orchestra - I have been playing the violin for about four years now, so this class was essential in my Freshman year of High School. I really enjoy the class, as well as our instructor, and I'm glad $

                        <li>Class 7: Physics Pre-AP - In all my years of school, Science was my favorite class to take, mainly because it was the most interesting. However, I have always hated Physics, since it's basically math on stero$
