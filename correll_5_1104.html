	<ul>
	<li>html is the core of a website, where all of the text, links, and other content belongs in the webpage. This would be where I would put a paragraph of text, a header, and some links to other pages.</li>
	<li>css is the part of a website that has all of the decorative parts of the page, including color, font, and other style options.</li>
	<li>divs define different divisions in an html and sort them into their categories.</li>
	<li>ids specify a unique item, or group of specific items in a html.</li>
	<li>classes are elements that classify a bunch of other elements in a html to give them similar attributes or style.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These create moving and non-moving squares by using specific classes, divs, and ids that tell the squares to either be static, relative, absolute, etc. So, a group of squares will stay in place while the others will move because they are in different classes, divs, or ids.</p>
