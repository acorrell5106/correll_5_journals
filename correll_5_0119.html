	<p>How successful were you with review 2? I feel as if I was very successful beacuase I knew how to create the website as accurately as possible.</p>
	<p>What problems did you solve? Some of the problems I solved was trying to get all of the boxes to be proportional to each other, and I did this by changing the margins and the positions of all of the boxes.</p>
