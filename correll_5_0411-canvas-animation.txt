	What is the process for creating images in Canvas?
To create an image, you have to specify the points of said shape and then fill it in.
	Given your experience with JavaScript and possibly other code, how do you predict you will make animations in Canvas?
To create the animation, I know you have to change the coordinates of the shape multiple times, so perahps there will be a function for this.
