	<p>We are redoing this website because most failed to create a website with enough content, plus many did not even function or have enough pages in the first place. I had to redo my website, and I need to make sure I have enough pages with enough information in each. I need to have hrefs for each page that links to that file depending on where you are at in the directory. I also need to make sure I have all of the semantic elements in place.</p>
