	<p>What is algorithmic art? - Algorithmic art is art that can be created from numbers and, more specifically, an algorithm.</p>
	<p>What might make algorithmic art especially 'cool'? - The idea that an algorithm and numbers can create pieces of art all on their own makes algorithmic art 'cool'. So, different patterns that make up the art are all created through numbers, and I think that is really cool.</p>
	<p>What is a possible benifit to algorithmic art? - A possible benifit to algorithmic art could be the fact that all of it is in numbers, so it can be easily created and easily changed/altered.</p>
