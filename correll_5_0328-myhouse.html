  <p>Please describe the process to create your house: First, I started with a basic rectangle for the house itself, and then began adding rectangular windows and doors, a triangular roof, and circuler bushes and Sun.</p>
  <p>What were the behaviors leading to success? - To be successful in the house project, we had to stay focused on the task at hand, and not doinf something else that is unrelated. If this happened, our focus would not be on the house, and it would not get done in time.</p>
