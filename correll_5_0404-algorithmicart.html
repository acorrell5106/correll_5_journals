	<p>What have you accomplished with you art? - I've managed to have my art appear in a random matter, and they can change if you refresh the page.</p>
	<p>What is your plan? - My plan is to possibly add multiple colors that change randomly, as well as a button that changes the art when clicked.</p>
	<p>What have you discovered about visuals and algorithms? - I now understand how Canvas can work with for loops and if statements, so creating random works of art using these is much easier. For example, I can alter the coordinates and the size of shapes, as well as changing their color.</p>
