	<p>What have we accomplished while making an emulation webpage?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We were able to create a really awesome webpage that had a lot of ducks/mallards on it.</li>
		<li>We learned more about how to include images into a webpage.</li>
		<li>We got to practice using divs and learned more about how to use them correctly and in relation to each other.</li>
		<li>We learned some new things that helped us, such as z-index and background-image.</li>
		<li>We used GIMP a lot, so we learned a lot more on how to use it.</li>
	</ul>
