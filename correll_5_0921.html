	<h1>Addison Correll's Journal 0921</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>What is the difference between a dynamic and a static link? - A static link doesn't change at all, while a dynamic link is a link that depends on the current file location.</li>
		<li>How does one create a zip file with a directory? - When you type "zip", then the name of the zip and th files you want to put in the zip, the zip will be created in the directory.</li>
		<li>Why might it be important to give our files unique names in a webpage class? - I think that naming files in a unique way is very important in that we can identify what the file is and, more importantly, whose file it is. This will allow others to know who to give credit to and to be able to give an appropriate grade to said person.</li>
		<li>What is an a-tag? How is it important? What is the syntax? - An a-tag is an anchor tag, as well as a tag that defines hyperlinks. These tags are important in that they contain the links to other pages and places, and their destinations. The syntax is the way you write code in html, and how to make it understandable as well as writing it in a way that is going to work.</li>
		<li>Why should we test our web pages before we submit them? - We should test our web pages before we submit them because we will be able to find any flaws in the html that we can fix before it is too late. If we never tested the web pages before turning them in, there could be loads of problems that we didn't try to find and fix.</li>
